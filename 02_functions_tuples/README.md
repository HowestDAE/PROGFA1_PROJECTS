# WEEK 02: TOPICS COVERED
## THEORY
* Functions (basics)
* Use of docstrings
* Tuples + using [index]
* random.choice(tuple)

## LEARNING GOALS OF THIS LAB
* use top-down analysis to split every assignment into functional parts
* create functions for every functional part
* add a clear docstring for each function before coding
* create/ use tuples: unpack, [index]
* use the random library to get a random choice from a tuple
